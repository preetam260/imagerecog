# Browser-Based Object Detector Using TensorFlow and React.js

This project aims to build an intuitive browser-based object detection application leveraging TensorFlow.js, the Coco-SSD model, and React.js. 
Users can upload images to detect and highlight objects with bounding boxes and labels, offering a seamless experience for real-time object recognition.

## Key Features:
- Object Detection: Automatically detects objects in uploaded images and displays bounding boxes with labels for identified objects.
- COCO Dataset: Utilizes a pre-trained Coco-SSD model, capable of recognizing 90 object classes with high accuracy.
